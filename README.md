## Features

**Scheduele:**
The tool is able to download the complete working scheduele from the companies website. This scheduele (excel file) will then be transformed into a csv file. Given the csv file the days on which I'm working are extracted and for each day a .json file is created which includes my name plus the shift for that day. Given the days that I have to work, all coworkers working on the same day will added to the .json file plus their corresponding shift.

**Email:**
The tool is furthermore capable of sending pre-programed emails. Meaning that only certain parts of the email have to be filled in for instance holliday's or a shift exchange between coworkers.
