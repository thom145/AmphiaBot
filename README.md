Created a Bot for work to quickly send 'standard' emails and add days to work to personal 
calendar.

# ToDo
Website updated and now makes use of a token => automatic generation of a token needs to be realized.
When sending a 'standard' email notify co-workers involved => email list, functionality to add them in cc
